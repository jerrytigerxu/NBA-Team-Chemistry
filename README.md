- To get a more in-depth understanding of our project and the process by which it was built, check out our [final report](DOC/team172report.pdf)

## Contents of the CODE folder:

Data_Cleaning_&_EDA.ipynb: python notebook for our data scraping and cleanup of the dataset
Classification_Models.ipynb: python notebook for preprocessing and ML experimentation and results. 
NBA_Connections-main.zip: Package with code that executes our final D3 v4 visualization. 


## INSTALLATION

- Navigate to the CODE/ folder
- Unzip the NBA_Connections-main.zip 


## EXECUTION

- Navigate to the CODE/NBA_Connections-main/Vizualization/ folder
- VSCode --> Install Live Server (extension) --> Open 'dva_visualization.html' --> Go Live (bottom right corner) using Chrome

NOTE: The Live Server can be set up any which way convenient. Our recommendation is to use VSCODE: the environment where the visualization was built / tested. The JSON data file is available to download and use locally (https://github.com/alexmorton1212/NBA_Connections/blob/main/Visualization/dva_visualization.json), but the HTML already points to the dataset on GitHub
